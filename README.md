Their conquest of China and the establishment of the foreign Qing Dynasty was of notable worth, and Manchurian warriors were respected and remarkable in their respective fields.

  >The Skull Squadron was a fierce military unit stationed in Manchuria by the Japanese Empire for domestic and mainland uses. Their skull-related ornaments and death decor is coupled by their semi-elite status as a very effective combat unit, being mounted units in the army and partaking in hunting down guerillas in the rolling Jurchen fields or overruning Republican Army positions along the northern regions of China.
